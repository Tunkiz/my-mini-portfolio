            I want to be a developer at <b>SovTech</b> because I want to learn from the best #WORLDCLASS. I read the companyâ€™s mission and vision. After conducting my research I realized how my goals align with the purposes of the
            company. I have nothing but respect for the technological innovations SovTech has been developing. And I want nothing more than to be a part of a company that is changing the world. I see that as a way of moving forward in 
            my career. <b>I have the artistry, engineering and I can work with people.</b>
            This opportunity will enable me to showcase my skills and be a valuable team member who is able to grow and lead others.
