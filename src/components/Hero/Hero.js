            I want to be a developer at <b>SovTech</b> because i want to learn from the best. I read the companyâ€™s mission and vision. After finding out
            more information about your company from social media, I can clearly see how my goals align with the purposes of the
            company. There's nothing I love more than when I am working with other engaged individuals towards a common goal,
            and that's what excited me about this opportunity. <b>i have the artistry, engineering and i can work with people.</b>
